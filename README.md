## <a name="introduction">Introduction 👋🏽 </a>

Career switching from Marketing in SaaS to Software Development. This is for many reasons, including:
- Software development has a huge variety of tasks and always changing, so I will need to keep on top of the content - I love to learn and adapt to changes. 
- I am someone who is always seeking to learn and develop, and I have the creativity to problem solve. I have experience working as part of a team and individually in a professional environment.
- Passionate about problem solving and coming up with creative and efficient solutions.  I am a good communicator and a solid team player.
- Coding brings ideas to life. If you know what you want, know that it is possible to create it. This fuels my self-directed learning.
